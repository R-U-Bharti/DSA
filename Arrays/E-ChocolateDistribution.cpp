/*
Chocolate Distribution
Time Complexity: O(nlogn)

Description:
Given an array of N integers where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet.
Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates.
There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that:
# Each student gets one packet.
# The difference between the number of chocolates in the packet with maximum chocolates and
    the packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.

Example:
Input : arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56} , m = 3
Output: Minimum Difference is 2
Explanation:
We have seven packets of chocolates and we need to pick three packets for 3 students
If we pick 2, 3 and 4, we get the minimum difference between maximum and minimum packet sizes.

Input : arr[] = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12} , m = 5
Output: Minimum Difference is 6

APPROACH
------------------
# Initially sort the given array. And declare a variable to store the minimum difference, and initialize it to INT_MAX. 
Let the variable be min_diff.
# Find the subarray of size m such that the difference between the last (maximum in case of sorted) and 
first (minimum in case of sorted) elements of the subarray is minimum.
# We will run a loop from 0 to (n-m), where n is the size of the given array and m is the size of the subarray.
# We will calculate the maximum difference with the subarray and store it in diff = arr[highest index] â€“ arr[lowest index]
# Whenever we get a diff less than the min_diff, we will update the min_diff with diff.
